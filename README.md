# Hi, I'm Enitan 👋

I'm an SC‑Cleared Test Automation Engineer and Senior QA Lead with experience delivering high‑trust solutions across UK government and enterprise programmes. 
I specialise in building clean, scalable automation frameworks, validating complex data pipelines, and driving quality strategy across multi‑team environments.
Right now, I’m refreshing my GitHub with clean, modern examples of:
• 	API automation using PyTest
• 	UI automation with C# and SpecFlow
• 	Data validation tooling in Python
• 	CI/CD‑ready test frameworks
New repositories will be published shortly as I continue to expand my portfolio with practical, interview‑ready projects.
I’m open to hybrid/remote roles in London, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, and UK‑wide contract opportunities.
